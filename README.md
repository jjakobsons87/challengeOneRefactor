# Challenge 1 Refactor 

What is this site? 

What was this developed with and how do you install it? 
    It is developed using basic HTML and CSS. 
    
    This does not require any special install instructions. You can download the Develop file to your computer to run locally, or access the public page here: 

    Within the develop folder you will find an Assets folder and the html file 
    Within assets you should find some images as well as the CSS stylesheet. 


I refactored the code and style elements to be more streamlined and have less repetitive code. 

Install instructions:
