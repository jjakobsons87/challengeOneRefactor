What is this site? 
    This page is for the Marketing company Horiseon. 
    It is mainly informational as to what the company does: 
        Social Media Marketing,
        Search Engine Optimization, 
        Online Reputation Management 


What was this developed with and how do you install it? 
    It is developed using HTML5 and CSS3. 
    
    This does not require any special install instructions. 
    You can download the Develop file to your computer to run locally, or access the public page here: 

    Within the develop folder you will find an Assets folder and the html file 
    Within assets you should find some images as well as the CSS stylesheet. 


What was done within this project? 
    I refactored the code and style elements to be more streamlined and less repetitive. 

    I learned to use proper semantic HTML elements, including classes and ID's 
    Worked through condensing CSS elements to not be repetitive and follow proper styling
